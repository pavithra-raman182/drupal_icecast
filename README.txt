==============

Drupal as a icecast YP directory for D8

Icecast is an FOSS audio streaming server. It publishes streams, that can be listed on a Drupal site easily, by providing a CGI for the Icecast server to connect and update stream information to Drupal.
Using HTML5, we can embed the stream into an audio player!
